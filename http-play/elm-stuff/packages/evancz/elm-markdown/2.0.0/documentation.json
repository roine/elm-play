This includes stuff like [fenced\n    code blocks][fenced]. There are some odd parts though, such as [tables][]\n    and a setting to turn all newlines into newlines in the resulting output,\n    so there are settings to turn those on or off based on your preference.\n\n  * `defaultHighlighting` &mdash; a default language to use for code blocks that do\n    not have a language tag. So setting this to `Just \"elm\"` will treat all\n    unlabeled code blocks as Elm code. (This relies on [highlight.js][highlight]\n    as explained in the README [here](../#code-blocks).)\n\n  * `sanitize` &mdash; this determines if all HTML should be escaped. If you\n    are parsing user markdown or user input can somehow reach the markdown\n    parser, you should almost certainly turn on sanitation. If it is just you\n    writing markdown, turning sanitation off is a nice way to do some HTML\n    tricks if it is needed.\n\n  * `smartypants` &mdash; This will automatically upgrade quotes to the\n    prettier versions and turn dashes into [em dashes or en dashes][dash]\n\n\n[gfm]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/\n[fenced]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks\n[tables]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables\n[highlight]: https://highlightjs.org/\n[dash]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash\n",
